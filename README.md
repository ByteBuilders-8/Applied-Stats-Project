Abstract
---
Smartphones have become an indispensable part of our everyday lives, yet there is
growing concern about the possible detrimental effects of excessive screen time. We con-
ducted a survey as students to investigate the consequences of smartphone use on physical
health, mental health, academic performance, and social behaviour. Our study concentrated
on smartphone usage, which is currently the most popular gadget.

Data Analysis and Conclusions: 
Statistical analysis was performed on the data to derive meaningful insights. The analysis focused on the average screen time of students and its distribution. Additionally, comparisons were made between different variables, such as study habits, program pursued, and snack consumption during study hours. Confidence intervals were calculated to provide a measure of uncertainty in the results.
